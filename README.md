# 🖼️ Art Explorer CMS (Laravel Version) 💻

## 📜 Introduction

This project is a Laravel-based Content Management System (CMS) for an art gallery, converted from an earlier PHP procedural version PHP 🐘➡️❤️ Laravel. It allows administrators to manage artwork and artist information, while providing a public frontend for users to explore the collection 🌍. The project utilizes the Laravel framework, Blade templating, Eloquent ORM, and MySQL 💾, inspired by the structure of datasets like the [National Gallery of Art Open Access Dataset](https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/opendata). This version fulfills the requirements for the HTTP-5225 Web Development Project, including authentication, multiple CRUD modules, and database relationships ✅.

## ✨ Features and 🗃️ Database Schema

This application implements several key features for both public users and administrators, backed by a relational database structure managed via Laravel Migrations.

**Key Features:**

* **🌐 Public Frontend:**
    * Homepage displaying featured artworks (using `HomeController`).
    * Paginated artwork collection page (`/collection`) with details fetched via `ArtworkController`.
    * Individual artwork detail pages (`/collection/{artwork}`).
    * "Art of the Day" page displaying a random artwork (`/art-of-the-day`) 🎨.
    * Alphabetically grouped artist list page (`/artists`) generated by `ArtistController` 🧑‍🎨.
    * Individual artist detail pages (`/artists/{artist}`) showing artist bio and their associated artworks.
    * Static 'About' page (`/about`) served by `PageController`.
    * Responsive design using Bootstrap, integrated via Vite.

* **🔒 Admin Backend (`/admin` prefix):**
    * User Authentication and Registration provided by Laravel Breeze 🔑.
    * Role-based redirection upon login (`/dashboard` route logic).
    * Admin Dashboard (`admin/dashboard`) showing relevant links based on user role (requires `isAdmin` or `isArtist` methods on User model) 📊.
    * **CRUD Module 1: Artworks:** Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for artworks (`AdminArtworkController`, views in `admin/artworks`). Includes fields like title, description, image URL, and artist assignment 🖼️.
    * **CRUD Module 2: Artists:** Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for artists (`AdminArtistController`, views in `admin/artists`). Includes fields like name, bio, nationality, birth/death years 🧑‍🎨.
    * (Optional CRUD): User management potentially restricted to admins (`UserController`, views in `admin/users`) 👥.
    * User Profile Management (from Breeze) accessible within the admin area (`/admin/profile`) 👤.

**Database Schema:**

The core database structure is defined using Laravel Migrations and includes the following tables and relationships:

1.  **`users` Table:** Managed by Laravel and Breeze. Contains standard user fields (id, name, email, password, timestamps) plus a custom `role` column (e.g., 'admin', 'artist', 'user') to manage permissions.
2.  **`artists` Table:** Stores information about artists (id, preferred\_display\_name, bio, nationality, birth\_year, death\_year, timestamps).
3.  **`artworks` Table:** Stores information about artworks (id, title, description, image\_url, artist\_id, timestamps).
    * **Relationship:** Contains a `artist_id` foreign key column which links to the `id` column on the `artists` table. This establishes a **one-to-many relationship**: one Artist can have many Artworks 🔗. This relationship is defined and utilized in the `Artist` and `Artwork` Eloquent models.
4.  **Standard Laravel Tables:** `migrations`, `password_reset_tokens`, `sessions`, `cache`, `jobs`, etc., support framework functionality ⚙️.

This schema allows for efficient querying and management of related artist and artwork data, fulfilling the assignment requirement for at least one relationship between the two CRUD modules 👍.
